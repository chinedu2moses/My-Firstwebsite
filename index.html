            <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>

            <p>I am excited to be working with people and really making a difference in their lives.<br>
                 I remember being so upset in class as a child because I did not understand what was being<br> talked about in the classroom.
                  A dedicated teacher helped me by recognizing my learning disability and<br> finding ways to assist me.
                   I owe my success to this amazing teacher who changed my life.<br>
                 Those experiences made me who I am today, and I am now helping others.<br>
                 I work hard to make sure that my team is the best through being supportive to every team member.<br>
                  I love to be proud of my job and always like to make difference in every position I held.<br>
                 I am an engineer who most importantly embraces the development of a trusting environment with my team members.<br>
                 One of the skills I will utilize in achieving the before mentioned environment is found in the ability to efficiently<br> build trust with the team members.
                  I will not only provide educational data from the curriculum but am a good <br>listener and always willing to respond in kind to all ideas
                   presented by the team and the job community.<br>Team members know me for paying attention to details<br>
                    I will also respond well to change in being open to learning from others in trying new approaches in<br> lesson construction and delivery.
                 involving in goal setting where appropriate, and being able to recognize and seize the <br>
                 moment when practical moments occur. All these approaches can be fostered through creative planning. <br>
                 I am committed to inspiring this critical exploration through stimulating teamwork amongst peers,<br>
                 being aware of different learning styles, working across subject boundaries, providing individualized accommodations,<br>
                  involving in goal setting where appropriate, and being able to recognize and seize the moment when job delivery moments occur.
